### RESULT:
* got the calculated drain current=5.55e-005 in DC analysis output by calculating the NMOS length=175nm and width=178nm.
* The circuit maintains its performance across the tested frequency range.
* The circuit reacts well to changes and conforming its stability.

### INFERENCE:
* Q-point determines the MOSFET oprating region.
* Gate voltage is high enogh to turn on the MOSFET.
* Drain current indicates power consumption and tranceconductance.
* By ac analysis we get the gain.

### RESULT:
* By varying the channel dimensions (L,W) of both MOSFET (M1 & M2), The desired currnt was achived at
   1. M1: L=500nm, W=950nm.
   2. M2: L=300nm, W=1020nm.
* The gain is 3.8dB and phase shift  which is nealy 180 degree align with theoretical expectations.
* The circuit responds effectively to input variations, indicating stable operation.

### INFERENCE:
* By varying the MOSFET dimensions, Get the calculated drain currnt value in simulation.
* Vary both MOSFET(M1 & M2) to get the calculated drain current.
* Generally input impedance is high in MOSFET.
* Coupling and bypass capacitors affect the frequency response.
* Gain depends on the MOSFET parameters.
